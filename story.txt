This is a story about the “Little Red Riding Hood”, and the story can be different as the familiar one story. 
Once a upon a time, there's a Little Red Riding Hood, whose name is Lucy and she lived with her grandma in the estate, she's very rich and don't like everything and don't go to school until she met a boy ..... 

The boy also wear a hood and they become friends. Later they find out that there are so many boys and girls wearing hood because it is fashionable at the time, so they found a group called brother and sister HOOD.

Brother and Sister Hood becomes a very popular group in the area. So much so that Lucy and her new friends start a successful fashion line selling hoods not only in red, but in various colors and designs.
